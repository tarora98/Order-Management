Language: TypeScript
Framework: Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL

The solution includes the following components:

API Endpoints: 

    The web service implements several endpoints using Express.js to handle the CRUD operations for managing orders. The endpoints include:

    POST /orders: Creates a new order.
    GET /orders/:id: Retrieves the details of a specific order.
    PUT /orders/:id: Updates the details of a specific order.
    DELETE /orders/:id: Deletes a specific order.
    GET /orders: Retrieves all orders.
    Error Handling: The service handles edge cases and returns appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios. For example, when creating or updating an order, it checks if there is a pre-existing order within the last 3 hours and returns an error if applicable.

Data Persistence: 
    The solution uses a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve order data. The sample data provided can be used to populate the initial database.

Testing: 
    The solution includes a test suite using a test framework like Jest or Mocha. The tests cover the API endpoints and ensure the service and database are functioning as expected.

Trade-offs and Assumptions:

    Trade-offs: 
        Given the time constraint, the solution focuses on implementing the core functionality of the order management system. Additional features such as authentication, authorization, and input validation could be added for a production-ready system.

    Assumptions: 
        The solution assumes that the database connection details are correctly configured and the required database tables/schema have been set up.


Changes for Production:

    If building this solution for production, the following changes can be considered:

    Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints.
    Add input validation and error handling for robustness and better user experience.
    Implement pagination or filtering options for retrieving orders to handle large datasets efficiently.
    Implement logging and monitoring to track the system's performance and troubleshoot issues.


Instructions to Set Up the Environment:

    Clone the repository provided.
    Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
    Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection details.
    Create the required tables or schema based on the chosen data model.
    Modify the database connection configuration in the code to match your setup.
    Run the application using the appropriate command (e.g., npm start).
    Execute the test suite using the test command (e.g., npm test).

Spec Completion and Time Spent:
    The solution completes the required specifications, including implementing the API endpoints, handling edge cases, returning appropriate HTTP status codes, returning JSON results, and including at least one test. The implementation took approximately 2 hours.

Challenges Faced:
    During the development process, challenges may arise in configuring the database connection and ensuring the integration between the service and the database. Additionally, handling the time-based constraint of 3 hours for pre-existing orders might require careful consideration and testing.
